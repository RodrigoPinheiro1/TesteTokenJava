Desafio para fazer uma aplicação spring com java,


Write a SpringBoot WebMVC REST Service that:
1. Given an array of Objects, returns another array that contains the same elements of the input array in reverse 
order. The original array must not be changed,
2. Same as (1), but the reversal must be done in-place, that is, the returned array must be the same that was passed 
as argument to the method.
3. Same as (2), but the argument must be a java.util.List
4. Given a CSV (Comma-separated values) file passed as a java.io.BufferedReader, returns an array of String 
corresponding to values of the fields;
